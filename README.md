# Factors Affecting the Number of Rentals in the MEVO Metropolitan Bicycle System by Olga Paszkiewicz and Aleksandra Susmarska

## Abstract
The aim of this paper is to help in the development of the MEVO bike-sharing system by analysing
user behaviour and identifying factors influencing station usage, as well as by proposing optimal
locations for new stations. We have analysed the available data using Python to examine station
flows, temporal trends and the influence of chosen factors on station popularity. Based on this
analysis we studied the impact of nearby infrastructure on the popularity of stations and chose 336
potential new MEVO station locations, increasing the availability of MEVO in residential areas by
13.29%. The complicated nature of the problem and outdated data sources limit the accuracy of
the results. However, it can still serve as a framework for more detailed studies in the future and
support strategic system expansion.
